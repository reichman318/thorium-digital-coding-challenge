# Thorium Digital Coding Challenge

- Implement the design as a web page using React/Nextjs, without the use of Bootstrap
- Export image assets from the Figma file at the link above (please let us know if you have difficulty accessing the design or extracting the images)
- No mobile design is provided, but you will make the page responsive using your own judgement regarding proper mobile layout, style, etc.
- You may use any information resources you need to complete the exercise, but you may not copy/paste code from another source.
